# NanoTTS python wrapper

This package is a python wrapper for the NanoTTS speech synthesizer utility as described here: https://github.com/gmn/nanotts.

## Installation

You can install this package with `pip install nanotts`.

## Usage

The NanoTTS python wrapper provides two methods to generate speech, one from a string input, the other from a text file.

```python
import nanotts

ntts = nanotts.NanoTTS()

# Generate speech from a string
ntts.speaks("Hello World!")

# Generate speech from a text file
ntts.speak("input.txt")
```

The attributes that can be set are described below:

* `loglevel`: set loglevel for the logging module (i.e. `logging.*`)
* `outputFile`: set name of the output .wav file (at least one of `outputFile` and `play` has to be set)
* `pitch`: set pitch in range [0.5, 2.0]
* `play`: toggle whether to directly play the created speech (at least one of `outputFile` and `play` jas to be set)
* `speed`: set speed in range [0.2, 5.0]
